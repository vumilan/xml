         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
         <p>China's historical civilization dates from at least 1200 B.C.; from the 3rd century B.C. and for the next two millennia, China
            alternated between periods of unity and disunity under a succession of imperial dynasties. In the 19th and early 20th centuries,
            the country was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the Chinese
            Communist Party under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed
            strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping
            and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population,
            living standards have improved dramatically but political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s, China has increased
            its global outreach and participation in international organizations.

      <div class="container-fluid bg-3 d-inline-block" id="id_2_economy">
         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Economy</strong></h2><strong>Overview:</strong><p>Since the late 1970s, China has moved from a closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a major
            global role. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion, resulting in efficiency gains that have contributed to
            a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Reforms began with the phaseout of collectivized agriculture, and expanded
            to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, growth
            of the private sector, development of stock markets and a modern banking system, and opening to foreign trade and investment.
            China continues to pursue an industrial policy, state support of key sectors, and a restrictive investment regime. From 2013
            to 2017, China had one of the fastest growing economies in the world, averaging slightly more than 7% real growth per year.
            Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2017 stood as the largest economy
            in the world, surpassing the US in 2014 for the first time in modern history. China became the world's largest exporter in
            2010, and the largest trading nation in 2013. Still, China's per capita income is below the world average.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In July 2005 moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid-2005 to late 2008, the renminbi
            (RMB) appreciated more than 20% against the US dollar, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from
            the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing announced it would resume a gradual appreciation. From
            2013 until early 2015, the renminbi held steady against the dollar, but it depreciated 13% from mid-2015 until end-2016 amid
            strong capital outflows; in 2017 the RMB resumed appreciating against the dollar – roughly 7% from end-of-2016 to end-of-2017.
            In 2015, the People’s Bank of China announced it would continue to carefully push for full convertibility of the renminbi,
            after the currency was accepted as part of the IMF’s special drawing rights basket. However, since late 2015 the Chinese Government
            has strengthened capital controls and oversight of overseas investments to better manage the exchange rate and maintain financial
            stability.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The Chinese Government faces numerous economic challenges including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly
            low domestic household consumption; (b) managing its high corporate debt burden to maintain financial stability; (c) controlling
            off-balance sheet local government debt used to finance infrastructure stimulus; (d) facilitating higher-wage job opportunities
            for the aspiring middle class, including rural migrants and college graduates, while maintaining competitiveness; (e) dampening
            speculative investment in the real estate sector without sharply slowing the economy; (f) reducing industrial overcapacity;
            and (g) raising productivity growth rates through the more efficient allocation of capital and state-support for innovation.
            Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and by 2016 more than 169.3 million
            migrant workers and their dependents had relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of China’s population control
            policy known as the "one-child policy" - which was relaxed in 2016 to permit all families to have two children - is that China
            is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil
            erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the North - is another long-term problem. China continues to
            lose arable land because of erosion and urbanization. The Chinese Government is seeking to add energy production capacity
            from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on natural gas, nuclear, and clean energy development. In 2016, China ratified
            the Paris Agreement, a multilateral agreement to combat climate change, and committed to peak its carbon dioxide emissions
            between 2025 and 2030.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The government's 13th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March 2016, emphasizes the need to increase innovation and boost domestic
            consumption to make the economy less dependent on government investment, exports, and heavy industry. However, China has made
            more progress on subsidizing innovation than rebalancing the economy. Beijing has committed to giving the market a more decisive
            role in allocating resources, but the Chinese Government’s policies continue to favor state-owned enterprises and emphasize
            stability. Chinese leaders in 2010 pledged to double China’s GDP by 2020, and the 13th Five Year Plan includes annual economic
            growth targets of at least 6.5% through 2020 to achieve that goal. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned
            enterprises in sectors considered important to "economic security," explicitly looking to foster globally competitive industries.
            Chinese leaders also have undermined some market-oriented reforms by reaffirming the "dominant" role of the state in the economy,
            a stance that threatens to discourage private initiative and make the economy less efficient over time. The slight acceleration
            in economic growth in 2017—the first such uptick since 2010—gives Beijing more latitude to pursue its economic reforms, focusing
            on financial sector deleveraging and its Supply-Side Structural Reform agenda, first announced in late 2015.;
