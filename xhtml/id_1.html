         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
         <p>The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam
            declared independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by communist forces under Ho
            Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the communist North and anti-communist South. US economic
            and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US armed forces were
            withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the
            country under communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth
            because of conservative leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals - many of them successful South
            Vietnamese merchants - and growing international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's "doi moi" (renovation)
            policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted structural reforms
            needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. The communist leaders maintain
            tight control on political expression but have demonstrated some modest steps toward better protection of human rights. The
            country continues to experience small-scale protests, the vast majority connected to either land-use issues, calls for increased
            political space, or the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes. The small-scale protests in the urban areas are
            often organized by human rights activists, but many occur in rural areas and involve various ethnic minorities such as the
            Montagnards of the Central Highlands, Hmong in the Northwest Highlands, and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region.

         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Economy</strong></h2><strong>Overview:</strong><p>Vietnam is a densely populated developing country that has been transitioning since 1986 from the rigidities of a centrally
            planned, highly agrarian economy to a more industrial and market based economy, and it has raised incomes substantially. Vietnam
            exceeded its 2017 GDP growth target of 6.7% with growth of 6.8%, primarily due to unexpected increases in domestic demand,
            and strong manufacturing exports.;
            
         </p>
         <p>Vietnam has a young population, stable political system, commitment to sustainable growth, relatively low inflation, stable
            currency, strong FDI inflows, and strong manufacturing sector. In addition, the country is committed to continuing its global
            economic integration. Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007 and concluded several free trade agreements in 2015-16, including
            the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (which the EU has not yet ratified), the Korean Free Trade Agreement, and the Eurasian
            Economic Union Free Trade Agreement. In 2017, Vietnam successfully chaired the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Conference
            with its key priorities including inclusive growth, innovation, strengthening small and medium enterprises, food security,
            and climate change. Seeking to diversify its opportunities, Vietnam also signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement
            for the Transpacific Partnership in 2018 and continued to pursue the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.;
            
         </p>
         <p>To continue its trajectory of strong economic growth, the government acknowledges the need to spark a ‘second wave’ of reforms,
            including reforming state-owned-enterprises, reducing red tape, increasing business sector transparency, reducing the level
            of non-performing loans in the banking sector, and increasing financial sector transparency. Vietnam’s public debt to GDP
            ratio is nearing the government mandated ceiling of 65%.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In 2016, Vietnam cancelled its civilian nuclear energy development program, citing public concerns about safety and the high
            cost of the program; it faces growing pressure on energy infrastructure. Overall, the country’s infrastructure fails to meet
            the needs of an expanding middle class. Vietnam has demonstrated a commitment to sustainable growth over the last several
            years, but despite the recent speed-up in economic growth the government remains cautious about the risk of external shocks.;
