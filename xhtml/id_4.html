         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
         <p>A Malay trading port known as Temasek existed on the island of Singapore by the 14th century. The settlement changed hands
            several times in the ensuing centuries and was eventually burned in the 17th century and fell into obscurity. The British
            founded Singapore as a trading colony on the site in 1819. It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but was ousted two years
            later and became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of the world's most prosperous countries with strong international
            trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of
            the leading nations of Western Europe.

         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Economy</strong></h2><strong>Overview:</strong><p>Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. It enjoys an open and corruption-free environment, stable
            prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. Unemployment is very low. The economy depends heavily
            on exports, particularly of electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, medical and optical devices, pharmaceuticals, and
            on Singapore’s vibrant transportation, business, and financial services sectors.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The economy contracted 0.6% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but has continued to grow since 2010. Growth
            from 2012-2017 was slower than during the previous decade, a result of slowing structural growth - as Singapore reached high-income
            levels - and soft global demand for exports. Growth recovered to 3.6% in 2017 with a strengthening global economy.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The government is attempting to restructure Singapore’s economy to reduce its dependence on foreign labor, raise productivity
            growth, and increase wages amid slowing labor force growth and an aging population. Singapore has attracted major investments
            in advanced manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and medical technology production and will continue efforts to strengthen its
            position as Southeast Asia's leading financial and technology hub. Singapore is a signatory of the Comprehensive and Progressive
            Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and a party to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations
            with nine other ASEAN members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. In 2015, Singapore formed,
            with the other ASEAN members, the ASEAN Economic Community.;
