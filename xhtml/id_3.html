         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
         <p>Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States
            of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original
            13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most
            traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern Union of states defeated a
            secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic downturn during which
            about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in
            1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively
            steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.

      <div class="container-fluid bg-3 d-inline-block" id="id_3_economy">
         <h2 class="margin"><strong>Economy</strong></h2><strong>Overview:</strong><p>The US has the most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $59,500. US firms are at or near
            the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers, pharmaceuticals, and medical, aerospace, and military equipment;
            however, their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. Based on a comparison of GDP measured at purchasing power
            parity conversion rates, the US economy in 2014, having stood as the largest in the world for more than a century, slipped
            into second place behind China, which has more than tripled the US growth rate for each year of the past four decades.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In the US, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed
            goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts
            in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products.
            At the same time, businesses face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US
            markets.;
            
         </p>
         <p>Long-term problems for the US include stagnation of wages for lower-income families, inadequate investment in deteriorating
            infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, energy shortages, and sizable current account
            and budget deficits.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The onrush of technology has been a driving factor in the gradual development of a "two-tier" labor market in which those
            at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get
            comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. But the globalization of trade, and especially the rise
            of low-wage producers such as China, has put additional downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on the return to capital.
            Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. Since 1996, dividends and
            capital gains have grown faster than wages or any other category of after-tax income.;
            
         </p>
         <p>Imported oil accounts for more than 50% of US consumption and oil has a major impact on the overall health of the economy.
            Crude oil prices doubled between 2001 and 2006, the year home prices peaked; higher gasoline prices ate into consumers' budgets
            and many individuals fell behind in their mortgage payments. Oil prices climbed another 50% between 2006 and 2008, and bank
            foreclosures more than doubled in the same period. Besides dampening the housing market, soaring oil prices caused a drop
            in the value of the dollar and a deterioration in the US merchandise trade deficit, which peaked at $840 billion in 2008.
            Because the US economy is energy-intensive, falling oil prices since 2013 have alleviated many of the problems the earlier
            increases had created.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis, falling home prices, investment bank failures, tight credit, and the global economic downturn
            pushed the US into a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of 2009, the deepest and longest downturn
            since the Great Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, the US Congress established a $700 billion Troubled Asset
            Relief Program in October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and industrial corporations,
            much of which had been returned to the government by early 2011. In January 2009, Congress passed and former President Barack
            OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on additional
            spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover. In 2010 and 2011, the federal budget
            deficit reached nearly 9% of GDP. In 2012, the Federal Government reduced the growth of spending and the deficit shrank to
            7.6% of GDP. US revenues from taxes and other sources are lower, as a percentage of GDP, than those of most other countries.;
            
         </p>
         <p>Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan required major shifts in national resources from civilian to military purposes and contributed
            to the growth of the budget deficit and public debt. Through FY 2018, the direct costs of the wars will have totaled more
            than $1.9 trillion, according to US Government figures.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In March 2010, former President OBAMA signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a health insurance
            reform that was designed to extend coverage to an additional 32 million Americans by 2016, through private health insurance
            for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished. Total spending on healthcare - public plus private - rose from
            9.0% of GDP in 1980 to 17.9% in 2010.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In July 2010, the former president signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law designed to
            promote financial stability by protecting consumers from financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing
            with troubled banks that are "too big to fail," and improving accountability and transparency in the financial system - in
            particular, by requiring certain financial derivatives to be traded in markets that are subject to government regulation and
            oversight.;
            
         </p>
         <p>The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) announced plans in December 2012 to purchase $85 billion per month of mortgage-backed and
            Treasury securities in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates, and to keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment
            dropped below 6.5% or inflation rose above 2.5%. The Fed ended its purchases during the summer of 2014, after the unemployment
            rate dropped to 6.2%, inflation stood at 1.7%, and public debt fell below 74% of GDP. In December 2015, the Fed raised its
            target for the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.25%, the first increase since the recession began. With continued low growth,
            the Fed opted to raise rates several times since then, and in December 2017, the target rate stood at 1.5%.;
            
         </p>
         <p>In December 2017, Congress passed and President Donald TRUMP signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among its various provisions,
            reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; lowers the individual tax rate for those with the highest incomes from 39.6%
            to 37%, and by lesser percentages for those at lower income levels; changes many deductions and credits used to calculate
            taxable income; and eliminates in 2019 the penalty imposed on taxpayers who do not obtain the minimum amount of health insurance
            required under the ACA. The new taxes took effect on 1 January 2018; the tax cut for corporations are permanent, but those
            for individuals are scheduled to expire after 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) under the Congressional Budget Office
            estimates that the new law will reduce tax revenues and increase the federal deficit by about $1.45 trillion over the 2018-2027
            period. This amount would decline if economic growth were to exceed the JCT’s estimate.;
